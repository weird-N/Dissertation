                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>The rapid evolution of cybersecurity threats calls for authentication systems that balance robust security with user-friendliness. This study investigates the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and cybersecurity, focusing on web authentication systems and user perspectives. Key challenges in usability, user behavior, and security mechanisms are explored to propose user-centered design solutions.</p>

                            <td>Users face challenges in creating and memorizing passwords, navigating multi-factor authentication processes, and using biometric authentication systems. These complexities often lead to poor security practices like reusing weak passwords or avoiding MFA altogether.</td>

                            <td>While heightened security measures like MFA and biometrics improve security, they reduce usability, leading to user frustration or bypassing security protocols, which in turn decreases overall security effectiveness.</td>

                            <td>Users generally prefer simpler, more convenient authentication methods such as biometric systems and Single Sign-On (SSO), which offer a balance between security and ease of use, especially among younger, tech-savvy users.</td>

                            <td>Behavioral biometrics and AI-driven adaptive systems offer promising solutions for balancing security with usability by dynamically adjusting authentication processes based on user behavior. However, these methods raise privacy concerns and potential issues with false positives.</td>

                            <td>Biometric systems raise significant privacy concerns due to the immutability of biometric data. Users fear misuse of this sensitive data, as compromised biometric information cannot be changed like passwords.</td>

                            <td>Adaptive authentication systems, which adjust security dynamically based on context, and frictionless authentication methods, which minimize user involvement, are recommended to improve usability without sacrificing security.</td>
